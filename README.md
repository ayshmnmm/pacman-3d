# pacman 3d
 This project is a 3D implementation of the classic Pacman game. It makes use of openGL in C. Although the exact pacman mechanics are not replicated, the game is still fun to play with features such as dummy enemies.

## Getting started
 1. Clone the repo 
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ayshmnmm/pacman-3d.git
    ```

 2. Compile and execute

    gcc -o pacman *.c -lGL -lGLU -lglut -lm &&Â ./pacman
    ```
